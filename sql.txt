Aggregate functions 
What is Aggregate functions. 
    function which returns single value after processing data is called Aggregate function.
Sum
    returns sum of numeric field 
Min 
    returns minimum value of given numeric field 
Max
    returns maximum value of given numeric field 
Avg
    returns average value of given numeric field 
Count
    returns no of rows in table 


get total amount of received payments 
    select sum(amount) from payments 
get minimum,maximum,average  amount of received payments 
    select min(amount) as minimum_amount ,max(amount) as maximum_amount ,avg(amount) as average_amount from payments 
get total no of payments (count of payments)
    select count(*) from payments 

get total amount of payments, no of payments customerNumber 112 
    select sum(amount),count(*) from payments where customerNumber=112

get customerNumber wise total payments 
    select customerNumber,sum(amount) from payments group by customerNumber

get total payment of each year 
    select left(paymentDate,4),sum(amount) from payments group by left(paymentdate,4)

joins
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
join operation is required when we require to display data from multiple tables.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) inner join/ equi join 
    inner join is used when we want to fetch data from 2 or more tables based upon condition set on common fields 

    what is common field?
    a field in one table whose type and range of values (domain value) matches with type and range of value in another table.
    
    fetch customerNumber,Name and his each and every payments details.

    select customerNumber,customerName from customers
    select * from payments

    merge both query 
    select c.customerNumber,customerName,p.* from customers c, payments p  where c.customerNumber = p.customerNumber

    
    display employees Detail and his office city & address  
    select * from employees e 
    select city,addressline1, addressline2 from offices o

    merge both query 
    select e.*,city,addressline1,addressline2 from employees e, offices o where e.officecode=o.officecode

    now join both query 
    select e.*,addressline1,addressline2,city,postalcode,state,country from employees e, offices o where e.officecode=o.officecode


    display orderNumber,orderDate,Status and customerName & customerNumber of those customers who are from usa 

    select orderNumber,orderDate,status from orders o select o.orderNumber,orderDate,status from orders o; 

    select customerNumber,customerName from customers c where country='usa'    

    now join them 
    select orderNumber,orderDate,status,o.customerNumber,customerName,country from orders o, customers c where c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber and country='usa'

   
2) left  join
    left join is used when we need to fetch all rows from left side table and only matching row from right side table. here we use common field to match tables. 
   
    fetch customerNumber,customerName of those customer who has never given any order.
    select customerNumber,customerName from customers c
    select * from orders o 

    now join 
    select c.customerNumber,customerName,o.* from customers c left join orders o on c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber where o.orderNumber is NULL


    fetch customerNumber, customerName of those customers who has not given any payments 
    select customerNumber,customerName from customers c
    select * from payments p 
    
    
    select c.customerNumber,customerName,p.* from customers c left join payments p  on c.customerNumber=p.customerNumber where amount is NULL

     
3) right  join
    right join is used when we need to fetch all rows from right side table and only matching row from left side table. here we use common field to match tables. 

    fetch dummy orders 
    select customerNumber,customerName from customers c, 
    select * from orders o 

    join them 
    select c.customerNumber,customerName,o.* from customers c right join orders o on c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber where customerNumber is NULL

4) full join 
    full join is used when we want to fetch matching non matching data from both tables. 
    select e.*, o.* from employees e, offices o

what is sub query?
when we pass result of one query into another query it is called sub query. there are always at least 2 sql queries in sub queries.

1) findout employee whose working with Diane.
select * from employees e 
select officecode from employees e where firstname='Diane' 
now make query 
select * from employees e where officecode = (select officecode from employees e where firstname='Diane' ) and firstname!='Diane'

2) findout payments above average payment amount 
select * from payments 

merge them 
select * from payments where amount>(select avg(amount) from payments)

3) findout customerNumber and Name and payment amount who has made maximum payments
   select customerNumber,customerName from customers
   select amount from payments 
   select max(amount) from payments 

   now join them 
   select c.customerNumber,customerName from customers c, payments p where c.customerNumber=p.customerNumber and amount=(select max(amount) from payments) 

fetch customerNumber, customerName of those customers who has not given any payments 

    select customerNumber,customerName from customers c
    select * from payments p 

    select distinct(customerNumber) from orders o 

     select c.customerNumber,customerName,p.* from customers c left join payments p on c.customerNumber=p.customerNumber where amount is NULL and c.customerNumber in (select distinct(customerNumber) from orders o )

fetch customerNumber,customerName,pending amount of customers
select customerNumber,customerName from customers c
select orderNumber from orders o o
select orderNumber,quantityOrdered*priceEach from orderdetails od group by orderNumber
select c.customerNumber,customerName,sum (select quantityOrdered*priceEach from orderdetails od  where o.orderNumber=od.orderNumber group by orderNumber) from customers c, orders o where c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber
